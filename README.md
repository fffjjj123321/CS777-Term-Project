# CS777-Term-Project
Step1: Download dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/headsortails/covid19-us-county-jhu-data-demographics 
Step2: Use CS777_Term_Project_toTxt.py to convert the dataset to a txt file. (I used PyCharm to run it)
Step3: Use CS777_Term_Project_main_code.py to read Covid_Data.txt. (I used Jupyter Notebook to run it, and downloaded the results manually) Then we will have six data frames in six .json files.
Step4: Use CS777_Term_Project_DataVisualization.py to visualize these data frames. (I used PyCharm to run it)
